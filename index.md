The following exercises are designed to provide you with a hands-on learning experience in which you'll explore common tasks that developers do when building AI agents on Microsoft Azure.

If you don't already have one, you can sign up for an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). There's a free trial option for new users that includes credits for the first 30 days.
